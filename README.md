# Cognito-Search

Have you ever used the Cognito's UI in Amazon? Yeah, super painful. Inspired by dkerwin's [ssm-search](https://github.com/dwkerwin/ssm-search), I decided to make this small utility.
It'll search in your cognito user pools, looking for any matches in `Name` (case insensitive)

## Installation

```shell
$ pip install cognito-search
```

## Usage

```shell
$ cognito-search -s user-pool-name
Cognito Search version 0.0.1
Searching User Pool for ['user-pool-name']
Reading user pools from Cognito
................
{ u'CreationDate': datetime.datetime(2018, 8, 24, 10, 8, 26, 994000, tzinfo=tzlocal()),
  u'Id': u'REDACTED',
  u'LambdaConfig': { },
  u'LastModifiedDate': datetime.datetime(2018, 8, 24, 10, 8, 26, 994000, tzinfo=tzlocal()),
  u'Name': u'user-pool-name'}


Found 1 matches out of 1234 user pools from Cognito

```

If you need to specify an AWS profile to use, just add `--profile dev` (etc).

## Publishing Updates to PyPi

For the maintainer - to publish an updated version of cognito-search, increment the version number in version.py and run the following:

```shell
docker build -f ./Dockerfile.buildenv -t cognito-search:build .
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint make cognito-search:build publish
```

At the prompts, enter the username and password to the pypi.org repo.
